backup:
This is a working copy of the Model folder in https://github.com/shikhar91939/ShippingLabel.git and /var/www/magento/public/app/code/local/UMA/BarcodePackingSlip/Model on strapp

This displays the barcode on the left of the products list.

Why:
making a backup before starting doing changes to look like the FedEx shipment label
